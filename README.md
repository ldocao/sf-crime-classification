San Francisco Crime Classification
=======================



The goal is to predict for a given time and location the type of crime that will occur.

#My ideas
We can reasonnably assume that years over years, it's the same. So we should give an answer for a given day in the year, and a given time.

As a first step, let's give an idea as function of time alone, and we'll see for the date later. So there is the problem of time, and the problem of location.

1/ make a map of time averaging over all type of crime

I can make a function which plot for a given time the density of crime for a given type of crime. Then, I could overlay multiple type if I want, and make a movie of that.

2/ make a map of location over all time and type of crime


make filter function to subset by time, location, type.
